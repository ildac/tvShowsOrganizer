tvShowsOrganizer
================

Little script I use to keep organized tv Series episode, this is run once a day as a cronjob

*TODOs*:
- refactor the python project structure
- go multiplatform (macOs and Linux first, then Windows)
- autodownload subtitles: by third party script or custom script
- autodownload torrent file from the internet (using showrss.info personalized feed)
- find a way to keep track when new episodes are available (there is only an implementation for mac label working on 10.8)
